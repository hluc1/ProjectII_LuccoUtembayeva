                 <p class="aboutText">Avatar the last airbender is an animated telivision program which aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon. The series began in February 2005, and concluded with a two-hour episode in July 2008. Avatar: The Last Airbender is set in an Asiatic-like world in which some people can manipulate the classical elements with psychokinetic variants of the Chinese martial arts known as "bending". The series combines anime with American cartoons, and relies on the imagery of East Asian, Inuit, Southeast Asian, South Asian, and New World societies. It follows the protagonist, twelve-year-old Aang and his friends, who must bring peace and unity to the world by ending the Fire Lord's war with the other three nations. </p>
