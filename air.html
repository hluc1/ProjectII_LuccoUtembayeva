        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly problems and concerns; finding peace
          and freedom was the key to solving their difficulties in life. Airbenders continually sought spiritual enlightenment,
          and, as a result, all children born into the Air Nomads were benders. The first airbenders learned their art from
          the flying bison.</p>

        <h2>Style</h2>
        <p>The key to airbending is flexibility and finding and following the path of least resistance. Airbending is notable
          for being almost purely defensive, as well as the most dynamic of the four bending arts. Airbenders can overwhelm
          many opponents at once with large and powerful attacks that could prove fatal; however, due to the pacifist nature
          of the Air Nomads, such attacks are rarely used. Due to their aforementioned spirituality, they often adapt to
          the situation surrounding them and employ negative jing, preferring evasive maneuvers as opposed to direct confrontation.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>Strength</h2>
        <p>Unlike benders of other nations, who rarely use weapons in conjunction with their bending, airbenders commonly use
          their signature staffs to augment their powers in battle. The increased force generated by swinging the staff transfers
          more energy to resulting air blasts. With the staff's narrow profile, the currents can be more accurately controlled
          and even shaped into blade-like crescents of air, capable of cutting through solid objects.</p>
